#Find Vertical and horizontal side
prev_black = 0 #boolean if the previous colour was black or not
for i in range 2:
	order = [screen.width, screen.height]
	for y in range order[0 + i]: #first does vertical side, then changes the order to do horizontal 
		for x in range order[1 - i]:
			if pixel.colour == black:
				if prev_black == 0:
					pixel.colour = green #change track boundary to green
					prev_black = 1
			else: #pixel colour is white or orange
				prev_black = 0
				if pixel.colour == white:
					pixel.colour = orange #change all white to orange cuz mclaren and show that its been checked
