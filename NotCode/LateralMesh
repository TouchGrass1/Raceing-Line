Generates A 2d grid within the track to act as possible genes

how it work: 
  1) create a 'line' between each inner and outer points ( should line up now that is is resampled)
  2) split the 'line' evenly into x number of points


def buildMesh():
  lateral_divs = 10
  for i in range(number of points in resmpled order):
    inner_pt = inner_sample[i]
    outer_pt = outer_sample[i]
    for j, t in enumerate(linearlySpace(0,1), lateral_divs): #
        # Linear interpolation between inner and outer
        mesh[i, j] = inner_pt * (1 - t) + outer_pt * t
