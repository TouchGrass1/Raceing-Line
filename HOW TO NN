Method:
find track boundaries
divide track into small rectangles
pick a random point in each rectangle
create a cubic spline
ensure each point on the spline is in the track, not on boundary
use genetic algorithm - immitates the natural seleciton

constraints:
minimum turning circle of the car
vmax = 380 kph
amin = 
amax = 38.5
maximum speed at turns
max lateral gripping force - force experienced is mv^2/r, max force = mu*NCF therefore v^2/r =< mu*g where r>= rmin (min turning radius)
max accel and decell


assumptions:
point mass
2d only
0 reaction time

Finding Mu:
factors: tyre compound - start with only one for now, tyre wear, tyre temp
