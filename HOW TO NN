Method:
find track boundaries
divide track into small rectangles
pick a random point in each rectangle
create a cubic spline
ensure each point on the spline is in the track, not on boundary
use genetic algorithm - immitates the natural seleciton

constraints:
minimum turning circle of the car
vmax = 380 kph
amin = -24.5
amax = 10.7
mass_min = 878 (798 + 80kg driver)
mass_max = 988 (110kg of fuel)
maximum speed at turns
max lateral gripping force - force experienced is mv^2/r, max force = mu*NCF + (downforce) therefore v^2/r =< mu*g where r>= rmin (min turning radius)
max accel and decell
mu_soft = 1.4
mu_med = 1.3
mu_hard = 1.2
max corner accel = 4g (not including vertical accel, only lateral)
downforce = air_density * velocity^2 * downforce_coefficient * wing_area * 0.5
using stats from mercedes website
downforce = 0.174686x^2 + 25.6869x + 101.731

assumptions:
point mass
2d only
0 reaction time

Finding Mu:
factors: tyre compound - start with only one for now, tyre wear, tyre temp
warning, difference between mechanical grip(max grip by tyres) vs total grip (including downforce)
